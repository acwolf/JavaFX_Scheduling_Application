This application allows a user to create, update and delete customers in addition to creating, updating and deleting
appointments that include the user, a customer and a contact.  The application will ensure that customers can not
be scheduled for appointments at overlapping times or outside business hours regardless of the timezone in which
the user may be working. Login screen supports both English and French.

My additional report requirement displays customers without any appointments.
